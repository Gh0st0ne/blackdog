<img align="right" width="300" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/724/1*Dpf3zGMTvMZ94ydA2qIYmA.png" />

> The creation of this project is intended to be the largest OSINT API in the world, where it can be widely implemented in private and public sources, so mechanisms such as SIEM, Blue Team and Red Team teams can take advantage of information and correlation metrics from many sources of the same information. Thus having a larger surface analysis according to various references and points of view.
